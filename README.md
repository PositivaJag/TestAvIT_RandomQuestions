# TestAvIT_RandomQuestions


Randomizes the questions from the course book Praktisk mjukvarutestning for the course Test av IT-system at Lule√• Tekniska Universitet, spring 2021. 

Reads from text file. Randomizes the questions from the course book. Has some basic support to make sure that the same questions dont show up over and over again. 

Badly commented. Just a small program that does what I need it to do to train for the exam. 

This program can be uppdated to other course material by bulding a new text-file. You don't have to number the rows. 

Don't forget to change the path to the text-file to match your system.
