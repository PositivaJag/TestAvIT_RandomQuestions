# TestAvIT_RandomQuestions


Randomizes the questions from the course book Praktisk mjukvarutestning for the course Test av IT-system at Lule√• Tekniska Universitet, spring 2021. 

Reads from text file. Randomizes the questions from the course book. Has some basic support to make sure that the same questions dont show up over and over again. 

Badly commented. Just a small program that does what I need it to do to train for the exam.
